biotoolsSchema elements
=======================

A summary of elements in biotoolsSchema is below.  For more detailed information, please see the `technical documentation <http://bio-tools.github.io/biotoolsSchema/>`_.


.. important::
   When producing XML files compliant to the schema, it is essential to stick to the element order (including nested elements) as described below.  See the sample `XML files <https://github.com/bio-tools/biotoolsSchema/tree/master/stable/example_files>`_. 

Element groups
--------------
biotoolsSchema includes scientific, technical and administrative software attributes, organised for convenience into 8 logical groupings (see below).

.. note::
   As of biotoolsSchema 3.3.0, all of the element groups *other than* "Summary" and "Labels" are reflected as elements/objects in biotoolsSchema/biotoolsSchemaJ.

.. csv-table::
   :header: "Group", "XSD element", "Description"
   :widths: 25, 50, 50
	    
   "Summary", "summary", "Basic information about the software."
   "Function", "function", "Details of the function(s) (i.e. modes of operation) the software provides, expressed in terms from the EDAM ontology."
   "Labels", "label", "Miscellaneous scientific, technical and administrative details of the software, expressed in terms from controlled vocabularies."
   "Links", "link", "Miscellaneous links for the software e.g. repository, issue tracker or mailing list."
   "Downloads", "download", "Links to downloads for the software, e.g. source code, virtual machine image or container."
   "Documentation", "documentation", "Links to documentation about the software e.g. user manual, API documentation or training material."
   "Publications", "publication", "Publications about the software."
   "Relations", "relation", "Details of a relationship this software shares with other software registered in bio.tools."
   "Credits", "credit", "Individuals or organisations that should be credited, or may be contacted about the software."


Summary group
-------------
*Basic information about the software.*

.. note::
   See the `Curators Guide <http://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/curators_guide.html#summary-group>`__.  As of biotoolsSchema 3.0.0, the Summary group does not have a corresponding element/object in biotoolsSchema/biotoolsSchemaJ (the schema was flattened).

	    
Function group
--------------
*Details of a function (i.e. mode of operation) the software provides, expressed in terms from the EDAM ontology.*

Each software entity has one more functions, each corresponding to a mode of operation that the software provides.  Each function performs one or more basic operations, and has zero or more primary input and/or output data, each of a specified type and supported format(s).
For each operation, data or format element, an `EDAM ontology <https://github.com/edamontology/edamontology>`_ concept URL and/or term are specified.  

.. image:: images/function.png

.. figure:: images/operation.png

   Data and Format are modelled in the same way as Operation (shown above).
  

.. csv-table::
   :header: "Element", "Description", "Type", "Cardinality"

   "note", "Concise comment about this function, if not apparent from the software description and EDAM annotations.", "xs:token (restriction)", "0 or 1"
   "cmd", "Relevant command, command-line fragment or option for executing this function / running the tool in this mode.", "xs:token (restriction)", "0 or 1"

.. important::

   The URL must be in the appropriate EDAM Operation | Data | Format namespace, *e.g.*

   * http://edamontology.org/operation_0492
   * http://edamontology.org/data_0863
   * http://edamontology.org/format_1929

   The term, *e.g.* "Multiple sequence alignment" must be either the preferred label of the concept or a synonym of this term, as defined in EDAM.
